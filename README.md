# e-commerce Database

## Introduction

This application is a mock-up database for an e-commerce website. It tracks products, product categories, and tags for products.

## How to use

In order to use this application you will need an API fetch manager such as Insomnia or Postman. You can call all categories, products, or tags as well as their associated data by calling their specific routes, which are /api/categories, /api/products, and /api/tags respectively. You can also add an /:id in order to call a specific id from said database. You can use a put request in order to update any of the data in these tables, a delete request to delete, and a post request to add new data to the table.
